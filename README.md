This is my portfolio website, proudly built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It uses the [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager by default, but can be used with `npm` or `yarn` as well.

I used to build my website using React, but decided to switch to Next.js because of its significant improvements that make it my first choice for websites.

This project is a constant work in progress, so if you find any bugs, typos or other errors, please feel free to open an issue or pull request. This project is open source, so please feel free to fork and adapt for your own projects (credit would be appreciated).
